## Basic Scripting

Scripting:
A scripting language is a type of computer programming language used to provide instructions, called scripts, to software. Scripts contain a series of commands that a software, application or scripting engine interprets one at a time within a runtime environment.

Bash: Bourne Again Shell is how we make linux do things. It could be used to write script

To start a script, we type a shebang (#!/bin/bash)

To execute a bash script, type bash <filename.sh> or ./<filename.sh>
    *when running a script the bash command only needs a read permissions unlike ./ that needs execute permissions

To add permissions, run chmod +x <filename.sh>
