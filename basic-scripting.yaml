## Basic Scripting

Scripting:
A scripting language is a type of computer programming language used to provide instructions, called scripts, to software. Scripts contain a series of commands that a software, application or scripting engine interprets one at a time within a runtime environment.

Bash: Bourne Again Shell is how we make linux do things. It could be used to write script

The beginning of your script file should start with "#!/bin/bash" on its own line. This tells the computer which type of interpreter to use for the script

    An interpreter:
        is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages

The script files also need to have the “execute” permission to allow them to be run.
To add this permission to a file run:
    chmod +x <filename.sh>

To execute a bash script run:
    bash <filename.sh> OR ./<filename.sh>
        *when running a script the [bash] command only needs a read permissions unlike ./ that needs execute permissions

When wrtting scrits, it is advised to make comments for an easy understanding of our script.
