## Linux command line Basics:

file: used to determine the type of a file
    e.g file README.md (ASCII text)
- Symbolic links provide a mechanism to refering to another file and can easily be identified by using ls -l or using file 

grep: searches for the named input
grep -i: ignore case distinctions
    *To best use grep, we need to pipe it to the previous output.

head: output the first part of files
head -n: prints the first K lines instead of the first 10
    *by default it prints the first 10 lines of a file to standard output

tails: output the last part of files
tails -n: prints the last K lines instead of the first 10
    *by default it prints the last 10 lines of a file to standard output

.: current directory
..: parent directory

mkdir: create a directory on linux
    -v: verbose (explain what is being done)
    -p: create parent directories

rm: remove files
rm -r: delete a directory (empty or not)
rm -i: prompt for confirmation before deletion
    *By default rm does not remove directories

touch: create a file
echo: print content entered (can also be used to create files or add contents to a file)

ls:
    ls -------> list the content of current directory
    ls -l   --> long list
    ls -ltr --> long list based on reverse timing
    ls -lt  --> long list based on Time
    ls -a   --> list hidden files
    ls -lh  --> long list files with human readable size
        *ls also accept arguements e.g ls Documents
        *to know more about ls we can loof at the manual (man ls)
