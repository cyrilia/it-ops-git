What is virtualization
  - virtualization is the ability to have a computer, exists on another computer
  - Computer has its resources such as
    - RAM - Memory
    - Storage - ROM
    - CPU - Processory
    - Graphics card
    - more

Virtual machine --> another computer, but it depends on the hosts to exist. S, without the host, the virtual machine can not exisit
  It needs to run on a hypervisor
    - A hypervisor is an application that gives a host computer, to share its resources with guest computer
      - Host is the physical computer
      - Guest is the virtual computer that needs to host, to exist.

  - There are two types of hypervisors
    - Type 1 hypervisor - runs on bare metal --> just the physical computer
    - Type 2 hypervisor - runs on a Host operation system --> physical computer + host operating system

    - We will mostly use Type 2 hypervisors, because we do not have an extra machine to spare, to run a type 1 hypervisor
    ! A virtual machine, is a fully operating syste, it has the base operation system and the binaries and folders and programs, that come on default
      with the operating system

Container --> its a type of virtual machines, that really is a file on your computer
  - It has to run ontop of an application such as docker
  - The Docker application, has to run on a type 2 hypervisor
  ! A container, is made up of the base operation system and the necessary applications, needed to work


The main operation systems out there are
  Windows
    Versions - Windows 11
    Version - Windows 10
    Version - Windows Server 2012
    Version - Windows Server 2016

  Linux
    It has many flavours --> because it is mostly open source: it is free for everyone to use, you do not need a paid license for it
      Main flavours:
      - Red Hart --> is not a free linux distro --> centos 
      - Debian -- > ubuntu & more
      - Fedora
      more
    
  Mac OS --> not free, not open source, you need to pay to use it
    -- > actually is built ontop of linux base operating system
  Solaris & others not free, need to pay to use it.
    -- > actually is built ontop of linux base operating system


  Today, we will start with docker

  # install docker

  Mac intel based processor --> 
  Windows intel based processor --> 
  Mac M1 based processor-->
